## Problem 1

#### Read in and describe the raw data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The Washington Post dataset contains information about 52179 homicides
that occurred in 50 large US cities between the years 2007 and 2017.
This dataset contains 12 variables that describe the date of the
homicide, location of the homicide, characteristics of the victim, and
status of the case related to the homicide. These variables are as
follows: uid, reported\_date, victim\_last, victim\_first, victim\_race,
victim\_age, victim\_sex, city, state, lat, lon, disposition.

#### Create `city_state` variable and `resolved` variable

``` r
homicide_df = 
homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

#### Summarize within cities to obtain total number of homicides and unsolved homicides.

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

#### Use `prop.test` function to estimate proportion of unsolved homicides, save output as an R object, and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from tidy dataframe using `broom::tidy`.

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sampleâ€¦ two.sided

#### Run `prop.test` for each of the cities, and extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence interval for each.

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

#### Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for reach city.

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

#### Create a dataframe that contains all file names using the `list.files` and `purrr::map` functions.

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(path, read_csv)) %>%
  unnest(data)
```

#### Tidy the datframe.

``` r
long_study_df = 
path_df %>%

  separate(arm_ID, into = c("arm", "ID.csv"), sep = "_") %>%
  separate(ID.csv, into = c("subject_id", NA)) %>%
  mutate(
    arm = recode(arm,
               con = "control",
               exp = "experimental")
    ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
