## Problem 1

#### Describe the raw data

The Washington Post dataset contains information about `r nrow(homicide_df)` homicides that occured in 50 large US cities between the years 2007 and 2015. This dataset contains `r ncol(homicide_df)` that describe the date of the homicide, location of the homicide, characteristics of the victim, and status of the case related to the homicide. These variables are as follows: `r names(homicide_df)`.

```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```


Let's look at this a bit

```{r}
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

```{r}
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

Try to iterate ........

```{r}
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```



```{r}
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```



```{r, error = TRUE}
city_prop_test = function(df) {
  
  n_unsovled ...
  n_total ... 
  
  prop.test(.....)
  
}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```





## Problem 2 ideas ...


import one dataset 

```{r}
data_1 = read_csv("lda_data/con_01.csv")
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(.............))
read_csv(path_df$path[[1]])
```
